        <p>Beam is a responsive web application for digital money transactions. This study is an example of a user-oriented approach. With the help of the Design Thinking process, two significant issues were identified that led to the
          refined
          functions of the application: the categorisation of transactions with the help of tags and the careful handling of user data. </p>
        <p>It should be noted that this project was created in the course of several months of training in user experience design. Three features of an application were created based on a fixed course plan and helped me to deepen my
          knowledge in user
          experience design. </p>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>To better understand my potential users and to see what applications already existed, I conducted an extensive background research. This included a general problem consideration and a Competitor Analysis, including Marketing Stategies
          and
          SWOT Profiles. With my initial findings and my unanswered questions, I conducted six interviews with people from my potential target group. After the interviews I organised my notes using Affinity Mapping into six categories. I was able
          to
          gain valuable insights and formulate the first opportunities and ideas.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>Two distinctive clusters can be formed from the previous research results. For each of these two clusters, I have created a characteristic User Persona. Persona Sami belongs to the regular, tech-savvy online shoppers and persona Till to
          the cautious users with a focus on transactions and data security. Then I wrote clearly defined User Stories to create Task Flows and then whole User Flows, which finally served as the basis for the designs of the three features. Once I
          had
          clarified the flows, I was able to start designing the architecture of the app so that seamless navigation was possible. For this, there were several iterations of the sitemap, where I further improved it with the help of Card Sorting,
          among other things.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>With the help of the Sitemap and the User Flows, I started to design the first wireframes with pen and paper. Step by step, the features and their fidelity level evolved with the aim of developing a clickable High-Fidelity Prototype.
          From
          the high-fidelity wireframes I created a clickable prototype, which was prepared with connectors so that an almost realistic use could be tested. </p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>Using the Gestalt Laws of Grouping as well as the Principles of Design, I iterated the design of the app. I also created a Soft 4 Point Grid for mobile as well as for the desktop version, which was used to align the elements. After that,
          I created a Design Language System based on a previously developed Style Guide. I also followed the WCGA guidelines to ensure optimal accessibility.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Several interviews, tests, feedback rounds and prototype iterations later, I learned a lot and I am very happy to have worked through the process so excessively. Nevertheless, I will take the following with me for all future projects:
        </p>
        <div>
          <p><span class="number">1</span> Test your ideas early and regularly with real users.</p>
          <p><span class="number">2</span> Let go of ideas if they turn out to be unusable.</p>
          <p><span class="number">3</span> Lean on your research results and stop doing guess work.</p>
          <p><span class="number">4</span> Don't reinvent the wheel, just do it better.</p>
          <p><span class="number">5</span> Don't be so detail-oriented, but focus on the big picture first.</p>
